# Cognizant Design Pattern Solutions - Week 1

This repository contains Java-based implementations of various design patterns, completed as part of the Cognizant Deep Skilling DN 4.0 assessment (Week 1). Each design pattern is demonstrated through a clear and easy-to-understand example, 
with all code written in a single file format for simplicity and quick review.

The patterns included are:

- **Singleton Pattern**: Ensures only one instance of a logger is used throughout the application for consistent logging.
- **Factory Method Pattern**: Demonstrates how different types of documents (like Word, PDF, Excel) can be created using a factory method.
- **Builder Pattern**: Used to build complex Computer objects step by step, allowing optional configurations.
- **Adapter Pattern**: Helps integrate third-party payment gateways by adapting their interfaces to a common format.
- **Decorator Pattern**: Adds multiple notification channels like SMS or Slack dynamically to a base email notification system.
- **Proxy Pattern**: Provides a proxy for loading images lazily from a remote server with caching for better performance.
- **Observer Pattern**: Implements a stock market system where clients (like mobile and web apps) are notified whenever stock prices change.
- **Strategy Pattern**: Allows switching between different payment methods such as Credit Card or PayPal at runtime.
- **Command Pattern**: Demonstrates how commands like turning lights on or off can be encapsulated and executed through a remote control.
- **MVC Pattern**: Follows the Model-View-Controller approach for managing and displaying student records in a structured way.
- **Dependency Injection**: Shows how a service class can receive its dependency (a repository) through constructor injection, promoting loose coupling.

Each pattern is implemented with a simple use case to clearly explain the concept. The files are named accordingly and can be opened or copied directly into any Java IDE such as Eclipse or IntelliJ for execution.
